        <p>Duke Montane Financial Inc. first listens to you and takes the time to understand your values, then discusses the numbers and the key components for what we can do using only renowned or very secure companies to achieve short and long-term wealth management.</p>
        <p>Key partners in strategies continue to evolve and are always changing, and you can trust us to broker, to be an investment allocator, and to review our of relevant information, partnerships and relationships on a constant basis.</p>
        <p>As the saying goes from Hericlitus, “change is the only constant in life.” There are times when bonds behave like equities, and there are short periods when GIC illiquidity can deliver sharp negative real returns. Your relationship with your financial planning contact should evolve with time, and you will change over time as well. We can tap into other professionals and their ability to achieve the results. For this reason brokering funds, using private wealth firms, insurance and annuities, shopping GIC rates and lending strategies, and institutional and pension money management are all what we do in securing a way to shape your future income, save for your major asset purchases, or help solve some tax inefficiencies.</p>
        <p>Access to reports and transparently providing information to you is valued to build your trust.</p>
        <p>For information specific to funds, recommendations, charting and planning future projections, please feel free to contact via phone or email and start to check out how your money can be better for you.</p>
