    <p>I am a 2nd generation financial services professional, and made the commitment to specialize in 2012. I received a Bachelor of Arts in English with a minor in Philosophy in 2005 from The King’s University College in Edmonton, AB, where I also played ACAC basketball for 4 years. Since, I have had a breadth of experience in different settings: social service and management including working in the innercity of Edmonton with homeless youth, running a painting franchise, directing basketball camps, traveling the U.S. coaching with NBC Camps and PGC Basketball, serving at the college and university levels both as an assistant and head coach for 6 years, and instructing post-secondary elective courses for the sport of basketball at Trinity Western University.</p>
    <p>Many endeavors contributed to developing character and work ethic as I often worked multiple jobs simultaneously. I never shy away from learning, and as such, time as a line-cook alongside red seal chefs was an inspiration and good job over the years. I capped of my journey prior my career choice with a semester of graduate philosophy courses at TWU. While none of these really have anything to do with financial services, they were shaping my abilities, viewpoints, and continually stretched and challenged me.</p> 
    <p>I have worked closely with industry mentors and am passionate about what is otherwise boring analysis. As a father myself, and having worked with hundreds of retirees, I feel blessed to continually gain perspectives and wisdom in life from clients and industry peers.</p>
